# Professional-Portfolio
My Work Portfolio


##Description
This is my Professional Portfolio and it houses links to projects I have completed. These projects showcase my ability to use different coding languages and techniques to create working web pages. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the main components used to build these projects. Each web page shows different methods to design and style and I will continue to add projects to my portfolio as I create them.
